      <h1>About Ivana</h1>
<p> My name is Ivana Tanoh and I just moved here from Washigton Dc. I have a younger brother named Kylian who's really into basketball and wishes to go to a business school. </p> A fun fact about me is that I love to travel and have visited ten different countries. I also speak three different langauages which are English, French and Spanish. I also like listening to music, reading and playing video games.
<p> I also play a variety of sports like soccer and tennis and I run tracks. I want to be able to be a great software engineer in the future hence why my major is computer Science.
